## IMPORTANT LEGAL POINTS

### What makes it legally binding?

✅ **All of these are legally binding:**
- Google Form responses + PDF agreement copies
- DocuSign e-signatures
- HelloSign e-signatures  
- Adobe Sign e-signatures
- Scanned PDF signatures (printed + signed + scanned)
- Even emails saying "I agree to the terms" + the agreement text

❌ **What is NOT binding:**
- Unsigned agreements
- Only the signature page without full agreement attached
- Verbal handshake (document it!)

### Recommendations:

1. **Keep copies forever** - both dated and signed versions
2. **Include full agreements** - not just signatures
3. **Timestamp everything** - use email timestamps or platform timestamps
4. **Both parties same platform** - both sign via same method (DocuSign, not "one prints + one DocuSign")
5. **One witness minimum** (optional but recommended) - have 3rd party initial documents

## FAQ

### Q: Is electronic signature legally binding?
**A:** Yes. Electronic signatures are legally binding in all US states under ESIGN Act (2000). Both parties just need intent to sign and record of the signature.

### Q: Which option is fastest?
**A:** Google Forms + PDF (same day signing)

### Q: Which option is most professional?
**A:** DocuSign or Adobe Sign (audit trail, certification)

### Q: Can we do this entirely remote?
**A:** Yes. All options work 100% remote.

### Q: What if we want to modify?
**A:** Before signing:
- Mark changes in document
- Email updated version
- Both parties acknowledge changes
- Then sign
- Add note: "Modified sections: [list]"

### Q: What if developer doesn't sign?
**A:** You have documentation that you sent agreement and they didn't sign. That's your proof they didn't accept. Don't start work.

### Q: Can I use just the signature pages?
**A:** Recommended: Include both signature pages AND full agreement copies. Otherwise disputes might claim they never saw full terms.
