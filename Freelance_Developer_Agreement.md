# ATTORNEY EVALUATION & RECOMMENDATIONS

## ✅ What Works Well in This Contract

1. **Deliverable-Based Payment** - Protects you from paying for incomplete work
2. **Weekly Milestones** - Creates accountability and allows quick course correction
3. **IP Assignment** - Ensures you own all work product
4. **Confidentiality** - Protects your business ideas
5. **At-Will Termination** - Allows you to end relationship quickly if not working
6. **Time Tracking** - Prevents time theft
7. **In-Person Requirement** - Clearly stated upfront

## ⚠️ Potential Issues & Considerations

### 1. **Compensation Rate ($25/hour)**
**Assessment:** Below market rate for developers

**Risks:**
- May only attract junior/inexperienced developers
- Higher turnover risk
- Quality concerns

**Recommendations:**
- **Option A:** Keep $25/hr but add 0.5-1% equity vested over 12 months
- **Option B:** Increase to $35-40/hr for better quality
- **Option C:** Add performance bonus (10-20% of total paid) upon successful prototype completion
- **Option D:** Start at $25/hr with guaranteed increase to $35/hr after 4-week trial

**My Recommendation:** Option D - Trial period with rate increase rewards both parties

### 2. **Independent Contractor vs. Employee Classification**
**Risk:** IRS may reclassify as employee if:
- You control when/where/how they work (in-person requirement increases risk)
- They work exclusively for you
- Relationship is indefinite

**Mitigation:**
- ✅ Contract clearly states independent contractor
- ✅ Developer responsible for own taxes
- ⚠️ In-person requirement increases risk
- ✅ Project-based with clear end date helps

**Recommendation:**
- Limit engagement to 6 months maximum initially
- Allow Developer to work for others
- Consider relaxing in-person requirement to "hybrid" (3 days in-person, 2 remote)

### 3. **Non-Compete Clause**
**Risk:** Non-competes for contractors are difficult to enforce in many states (CA, CO, etc.)

**Recommendation:**
- Keep it narrow (6 months, specific to telehealth AI, geographic limit)
- Focus more on non-solicitation and confidentiality (more enforceable)
- Consider removing entirely if in California

### 4. **In-Person Requirement**
**Risk:** Significantly limits candidate pool, may deter good developers

**Recommendation:**
- Consider "hybrid" model: 3 days in-person, 2 days remote
- Or: "In-person for first 4 weeks, then remote with weekly in-person meetings"
- This increases candidate pool while maintaining collaboration

### 5. **Weekly Payment**
**Pro:** Good for cash flow management
**Con:** Administrative burden (weekly invoices, approvals, payments)

**Recommendation:**
- Consider bi-weekly payment after first 4 weeks (trial period weekly)
- Reduces admin overhead
- Still provides frequent milestones

## 🎯 FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS

### Compensation Structure (Choose One):

**OPTION 1: Budget-Conscious**
- $25/hr for 15 hrs/week = $375/week
- Add: 0.5% equity vested over 12 months
- Add: $500 bonus upon successful prototype completion

**OPTION 2: Quality-Focused** ⭐ **RECOMMENDED**
- **Trial:** $30/hr for first 4 weeks (probation)
- **After Trial:** $40/hr if deliverables met
- 15 hrs/week = $600/week after trial
- Better quality, lower turnover risk

**OPTION 3: Performance-Based**
- $25/hr base
- +$10/hr bonus for early/excellent deliverable completion
- Effective rate: $25-35/hr based on performance

### Work Arrangement:
**RECOMMENDED: Hybrid Model**
- **In-person:** Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday (9 hours)
- **Remote:** Thursday, Friday (6 hours)
- **Total:** 15 hours/week
- **Benefit:** Collaboration + flexibility + larger candidate pool

### Payment Schedule:
**RECOMMENDED: Weekly (first 8 weeks), then Bi-Weekly**
- First 8 weeks: Weekly payment (close monitoring)
- After 8 weeks: Bi-weekly payment (proven reliability)
- Reduces admin burden after trust established
